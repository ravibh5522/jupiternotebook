They can be used to perform basic calculations and complex computations. Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:\n\n- Addition: 2 + 3 = 5\n- Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5\n- Multiplication: 4 * 5 = 20\n- Division: 10 / 2 = 5\n- Exponentiation: 2 ** 3 = 8 (2 to the power of 3)\n- Modulo: 7 % 3 = 1 (remainder of 7 divided by 3)\n\nArithmetic expressions are used in programming to perform a wide range of operations, from simple math calculations to complex algorithms. In Jupyter Notebook, you can easily create and evaluate arithmetic expressions in code cells using Python or other programming languages.\n",
